<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Links</h1><br/><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Email/URL Analysis References – With Narrative Commentary</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p><a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/</a> — CyberChef is a browser-based “Swiss Army knife” for analysts that lets you decode, encode, convert, and transform data without installing software. You can drag-and-drop operations (called “recipes”) like URL-decode, Base64-decode, XOR, regex extract, and HTML entity decode, then preview results live. It’s ideal for quickly unpacking obfuscated URLs, parameters, and tracking tokens directly in your browser.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://github.com/MalwareCube/Email-IOC-Extractor">https://github.com/MalwareCube/Email-IOC-Extractor</a> — An open-source tool that parses raw email content (headers and body) to extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, IPs, domains, hashes, and attachments. Useful for speeding up triage: feed it a suspicious message and quickly pull out artifacts for enrichment in other tools (e.g., VirusTotal, urlscan).</p><p></p><p><a href="https://phishtank.org/">https://phishtank.org/</a> — A community-driven clearinghouse of suspected phishing URLs. You can search to see if a link is already reported, review community verification status, and submit new phishing samples. It’s a good “first stop” reputation check when you suspect brand impersonation or credential harvesting pages.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.url2png.com/">https://www.url2png.com/</a> — A service that renders full-page screenshots of URLs. This is helpful when you need safe, passive capture of a page’s visual appearance for evidence or documentation—without fully interacting with the page in your own browser. Especially useful for before/after comparisons when kits change branding.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://urlscan.io/">https://urlscan.io/</a> — A web scanner and search engine for URLs that fetches pages, records requests, renders screenshots, and exposes network artifacts (domains, IPs, requests, technologies). You can submit a URL and then analyze the scan results (requests graph, HTML, JS, redirects) or pivot on related infrastructure to map a phishing campaign.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload">https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload</a> — VirusTotal aggregates AV engines, sandbox signals, and reputation sources to assess files, URLs, and domains. For URLs, you’ll see detections, community notes, historical submissions, and relationships. It’s a strong enrichment step after extraction—paste the URL or domain to get a multi-engine view.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.urlvoid.com/">https://www.urlvoid.com/</a> — A reputation checker that queries multiple blacklist and threat intelligence sources to score domains. It provides whois, DNS, host information, and historical data. It’s quick for an “at-a-glance” risk snapshot while you perform deeper analysis elsewhere.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.wannabrowser.net/">https://www.wannabrowser.net/</a> — A lightweight utility to fetch a URL with different user agents (desktop, mobile, bots) to see how the site behaves per client. Useful for detecting cloaking, device-specific lures, or conditional redirects often used in phishing kits to evade scanners while serving payloads to real users.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://unshorten.it/">https://unshorten.it/</a> — A link expander that reveals the final destination behind shortened links (bit.ly, tinyurl, custom shorteners) without you having to click them. Analysts use this to safely expose the true domain and parameters before submitting to heavier tools or sandboxes.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/">https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/</a> — A community project focused on tracking and sharing URLs used for malware distribution. You can search by URL, domain, or payload signature and download IOCs in feeds for automation. Great for quickly checking if a link is associated with known campaigns or payloads.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search">https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search</a> — Google’s Safe Browsing status portal lets you query site safety classifications. It reflects whether Google currently flags a site for phishing, malware, or unwanted software. Use it as a corroborating signal alongside other reputation services.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.joesandbox.com/">https://www.joesandbox.com/</a> — A dynamic analysis platform (cloud and on-prem) that detonates files and URLs in instrumented environments to observe behavior (network traffic, processes, dropped files). For suspicious URLs, it can capture redirects, scripts, and payload delivery chains, producing detailed, shareable reports for incident documentation.</p><p></p></div>
